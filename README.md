# SalamaThanksV1 Beta Testing
The goal of this beta testing round is to gather consumer-based comments for the first version of the SalamaThanks Web Application. This round spans  five (5) days, starting on May 16, 2022 (Monday), up until May 20, 2022 (Friday). The feedback form will be open until May 22, 11:59 PM.


The web app should be able to:
  - receive input and return output
  - swap languages using the two-arrow button
  - clear input using the X button
  - copy output using the duplicate button
  - receive speech input and convert to text
  - return speech output from text
  - redirect to the beta testing forms using the feedback button


The current limitations of the web app are:
  - a 256 character limit (although not explicitly stated on the web app)
  - strictly desktop browser configuration
  - inability to receive speech input on some browsers
